# psephulator

Psephulator is an open-source command-line tool for simulating elections. It's written in Rust. It's currently in a very basic state - essentially I have just written the code for the "proof of concept" example [here](https://clintonboys.com/projects/psephulator/). I plan to add more and more functionality as I find time to work on the project. If anyone else would like to contribute, please contact me, or just open a pull request!

The name is inspired by the word [psephology](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/psephology), which is the analytical or statistical study of elections and electoral systems.
